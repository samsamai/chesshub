# ChessHub

This is an implementation of a chess server using Phoenix and Elixir. It is based on https://github.com/joeyschoblaska/rails5chess. It was an exercise for getting into using channels and experimenting with phoenix.


To start your Phoenix app:

  * Make sure you have postgres running
  * Make sure you have redis running
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
